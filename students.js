I used cross contour drawing as these techniques defines the forms of the rocks, structures of the wall, land surface and human figure as if someone is looking at a topographic map. I changed Alex Honnold’s shirt to green to represent Sac State. Also, I added handles to the wall to represent where the event will take place, The Well’s climbing wall.'

I had the opportunity to design and develop a campaign for FoTA. My target audience has a wide variety of people ages between 15 and 50 who are welcome to join in the celebration of the arts. The primary objective is to bring people in and attend the festival to raise awareness and increase audience attendance. Through this, I designed a composition that is compelling and eye-catching that visually communicates the message. “Celebrating diversity through the Festival of the Arts” was the message I was trying to bring across throughout the campaign. The 3 words I focused on to help me design this composition and emphasize the message are diversity, unity and celebration and I based on my research through this message'

          description: 'If Color Was Language is an exhibition of artwork by Drew Ochwat. His artwork is a story of color and the relationship between street art and abstract expressionism. The challenge was to use Drew Ochwat’s artwork in a way that would complement his style while adding my own design in the composition. His work was the defining visual element in the different collaterals, pulling out different graffiti symbols and letters, expressive brush strokes, and abstract elements that were used throughout the composition. The color palette I used was chosen from the artwork as well. My intention was to interact the design with the artwork through the overlapping of shapes and the different layers in the artwork. The design elements such as the sharp, abstract and angular shapes coming off the page were used as a base for the diagonal grid. This was to balance the chaos from the front to the back.'

The house is spatially divided into three regions which can be determined from interior walls but also from the material division on the front façade. The main central space is double height on one half where the dining area and living area reside. The staircase is also in this area and leads up to a upper living area that is flanked by private living spaces. The design is meant to be simple and to blend with its surroundings so as not to take away from the natural environment. '

The focus of this project was to create a small private gallery for an eclectic art collector. My goal for this design was to play with the line of symmetry and divide the spaces intro three regions which each highlighted a certain collection. Gallery attenders would enter through a main pathway under a barrel vault and arrive at an important sculpture. After experiencing the grander sculpture they would pass a doorway which isolates a smaller Roman bust. Next the viewer has two other larger, double height spaces that can be explored. One is dedicated to a scroll collection and is meant to be a more private space to study the work. The other contains a library, glass display cases, and the stairway which leads essentially to this heavy floating box. Inside the room on the mezzanine are more display cases and the bar area. The space is meant to not only highlight the art within it but also to serve as a monument itself. '
