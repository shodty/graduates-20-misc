His work was the defining visual element in the different collaterals, pulling out different graffiti symbols and letters, expressive brush strokes, and abstract elements that were used throughout the composition. The color palette I used was chosen from the artwork as well. My intention was to interact the design with the artwork through the overlapping of shapes and the different layers in the artwork. The design elements such as the sharp, abstract and angular shapes coming off the page were used as a base for the diagonal grid. This was to balance the chaos from the front to the back.'

The front of the house differs significantly from the back, with the roofline alluding to the grandness of the exterior landscape in the backyard. The house is spatially divided into three regions which can be determined from interior walls but also from the material division on the front façade. The main central space is double height on one half where the dining area and living area reside. The staircase is also in this area and leads up to a upper living area that is flanked by private living spaces. The design is meant to be simple and to blend with its surroundings so as not to take away from the natural environment. '

The focus of this project was to create a small private gallery for an eclectic art collector. My goal for this design was to play with the line of symmetry and divide the spaces intro three regions which each highlighted a certain collection. Gallery attenders would enter through a main pathway under a barrel vault and arrive at an important sculpture. After experiencing the grander sculpture they would pass a doorway which isolates a smaller Roman bust. Next the viewer has two other larger, double height spaces that can be explored. One is dedicated to a scroll collection and is meant to be a more private space to study the work. The other contains a library, glass display cases, and the stairway which leads essentially to this heavy floating box. Inside the room on the mezzanine are more display cases and the bar area. The space is meant to not only highlight the art within it but also to serve as a monument itself. '

Our goal was to design a series of collateral promoting the Festival of the Arts with an effective design system that will increase awareness of the event and college programs, increase attendance, fundraising, and support President Nelson’s university initiative. The design solution was derived from observing motion in the arts. From dance to the soundwaves of speech, a human expression. Contrasting the organic forms, a geometric logo was created to simplify the name, and the thin stroked shapes further complexity and define layout.'

Throughout my studies I have transitioned from Fashion Design to Art History and finally arriving at Interior Architecture. I believe that through my work you can see my dedication and my ability to accomplish beautiful projects. My recent work includes an introduction to energy modeling and NZE design project, a residential project the Stilt House, Sacramento Ca, and a cliff hanging Pavillion. Creativity through building has always been part of me. Growing up my Dad and I would always build something, it didn’t matter what it was, I just knew that I could always go and create something big or small. Growing up in a creative hands-on environment has allowed me to understand our built environment in a logical and creative way. I consider myself a creative self starter, always inherently thinking of things a little differently than others. (There is more than one way to accomplish something!) I always strive to do my best and to always stay busy with something big or small. In the coming years I hope to be enrolled in a Masters program for Architecture, and eventually sit for my exams. I want to help support the integration of green and net zero design into the field so we can live harmoniously and push into the future with our environment and our future children in mind. This is a sample portfolio that includes select images from my best projects completed during my Interior Architecture progam.'

        description: 'This space is designed for AIA Headquarters and main goal was to take an existing building in the heart of Sacramento and turn it into a sustainable space. The biggest move was cutting out a large chunk of the building to provide a green space as well as an area for community to connect. This resulted in a natural sunlit space as well as allowed breezes to come through the space to offer natural cooling.'

This home is on stilts due to the fact that during the rainy season, the river floods which causes the Ground level of the site inhabitable. Keeping this in mind, the house will be able to be inhabited while the river floods the ground level. The shape of the house is rounded in order to mimic the river’s shape.'
