His work was the defining visual element in the different collaterals, pulling out different graffiti symbols and letters, expressive brush strokes, and abstract elements that were used throughout the composition. The color palette I used was chosen from the artwork as well. My intention was to interact the design with the artwork through the overlapping of shapes and the different layers in the artwork. The design elements such as the sharp, abstract and angular shapes coming off the page were used as a base for the diagonal grid. This was to balance the chaos from the front to the back.'

The front of the house differs significantly from the back, with the roofline alluding to the grandness of the exterior landscape in the backyard. The house is spatially divided into three regions which can be determined from interior walls but also from the material division on the front façade. The main central space is double height on one half where the dining area and living area reside. The staircase is also in this area and leads up to a upper living area that is flanked by private living spaces. The design is meant to be simple and to blend with its surroundings so as not to take away from the natural environment. '

The focus of this project was to create a small private gallery for an eclectic art collector. My goal for this design was to play with the line of symmetry and divide the spaces intro three regions which each highlighted a certain collection. Gallery attenders would enter through a main pathway under a barrel vault and arrive at an important sculpture. After experiencing the grander sculpture they would pass a doorway which isolates a smaller Roman bust. Next the viewer has two other larger, double height spaces that can be explored. One is dedicated to a scroll collection and is meant to be a more private space to study the work. The other contains a library, glass display cases, and the stairway which leads essentially to this heavy floating box. Inside the room on the mezzanine are more display cases and the bar area. The space is meant to not only highlight the art within it but also to serve as a monument itself. '

        description: 'Students were asked to design a pavilion with a specific site location in mind, in this case I chose a mountain top, a viewing platform and pavilion that would be used to enjoy the views and the outdoors.  To complete this project we used a combination of Rhino 3D modeling, Revit for 3D site layout, and Enscape to produce realistic renderings.  This project pushed students to explore and gain experience in  3D modeling programs and use these programs to enhance and fully develop their projects.'

Our goal was to design a series of collateral promoting the Festival of the Arts with an effective design system that will increase awareness of the event and college programs, increase attendance, fundraising, and support President Nelson’s university initiative. The design solution was derived from observing motion in the arts. From dance to the soundwaves of speech, a human expression. Contrasting the organic forms, a geometric logo was created to simplify the name, and the thin stroked shapes further complexity and define layout.'

    text: 'Hello, my name is Nuchee Vang. I am from Sacramento, Ca. I am Hmong American, raised by Hmong immigrants. In my family, I would be the first grandchild to graduate from a University. I am one of the oldest grandchildren, which makes it important to me to be a good leader for my younger sisters and cousins. I am currently graduating from Sac State, with a BFA in Interior Architecture. This year, our graduation ceremony was cancelled due to the current pandemic. This means that I would not be able to celebrate with my family, until the lockdown is lifted. Despite the troubles of this pandemic, I would like to showcase how I have improved my design projects through my education at Sac State. My education at Sac State has been incredibly rewarding; I found something that I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life. In my design journey, I have found my own style. Throughout my projects, I enjoy creating functional and minimalist design. My portfolio will demonstrate how I have grown as a designer in my own style, throughout my education at Sac State. Thank you for your time.  '
