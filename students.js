His work was the defining visual element in the different collaterals, pulling out different graffiti symbols and letters, expressive brush strokes, and abstract elements that were used throughout the composition. The color palette I used was chosen from the artwork as well. My intention was to interact the design with the artwork through the overlapping of shapes and the different layers in the artwork. The design elements such as the sharp, abstract and angular shapes coming off the page were used as a base for the diagonal grid. This was to balance the chaos from the front to the back.'

My design plays with a path to discovery, framing the view of the river, and creating a large, open central space for entertaining. The front of the house differs significantly from the back, with the roofline alluding to the grandness of the exterior landscape in the backyard. The house is spatially divided into three regions which can be determined from interior walls but also from the material division on the front façade.

The focus of this project was to create a small private gallery for an eclectic art collector. My goal for this design was to play with the line of symmetry and divide the spaces intro three regions which each highlighted a certain collection. Gallery attenders would enter through a main pathway under a barrel vault and arrive at an important sculpture. After experiencing the grander sculpture they would pass a doorway which isolates a smaller Roman bust. Next the viewer has two other larger, double height spaces that can be explored. One is dedicated to a scroll collection and is meant to be a more private space to study the work. The other contains a library, glass display cases, and the stairway which leads essentially to this heavy floating box. Inside the room on the mezzanine are more display cases and the bar area. The space is meant to not only highlight the art within it but also to serve as a monument itself. '

The biggest move was cutting out a large chunk of the building to provide a green space as well as an area for community to connect. This resulted in a natural sunlit space as well as allowed breezes to come through the space to offer natural cooling.'
